# Math and Equations

Depending on background, math and equations may be an intimidating ‚Äúforeign language‚Äù to some students. This brief appendix aims to
offer a refresher on techniques, and hopefully inspire a more peaceful relationship for students.

## Relax on the Decimals

First, we can form a more natural, forgiving relationship with numbers. Like your friends, they need not be held to exacting standards: they are simply trying to tell you something useful. Remembering that is roughly 3 is far more important than committing any further decimals to memory. If a friend traced out a circle in the sand and asked how much area it had,[^1] the poorly-defined and irregular boundary defies precisemeasurement, so why carry extra digits. Maybe just recognize that the radius is roughly one meter, so the area is about 3 square meters. Done.[^2]

The message here is to give yourself a break and just not over-represent the precision (number of decimals) in your answer. 

Part of the reason students have a rigid relationship with numbers is because homework and test problems tend to come pre-loaded with
numbers assumed to be exactly known. But the real world is seldom so generous, leaving us to forage for approximate numbers and estimations. By being approximate in our use of numbers, we are liberated to do math in our heads more readily. Practice can make this into a life-long skill that becomes second nature. It is helpful to know some shortcuts.

Some classes formalize the concept of significant digits, which is all well and good. But such systems can add to the stress of students learning the material (one more thing that can be wrong!).
