This book has evolved out of my teaching a course on energy, the environment, and climate. Some books available are excellent, but they are too expensive. Some books are too shallow and others too deep. I wanted to create a book that is interactive, involves exploration of publicly available data, and introduces students to current scientific publications. While this book is brief in its content, it is meant to incorporate many external resources to paint a vivid picture of our connection to Earth and its systems. I have attempted to keep this book accessible to anyone with basic algebra skills, and I particularly hope to make non-STEM students feel welcome and capable in a science classroom. Anyone is welcome to compile their own version including or excluding chapters.
